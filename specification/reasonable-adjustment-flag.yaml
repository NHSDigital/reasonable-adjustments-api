  title: Reasonable Adjustment Flag API
  description: |-
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access and update the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#top) - a national record which indicates that a patient requires reasonable adjustments and optionally includes details of impairments and adjustments to be considered.

    You can:
     - check if a Reasonable Adjustment Flag exists
     - read a Reasonable Adjustment Flag
     - create a Reasonable Adjustment Flag
     - update a Reasonable Adjustment Flag
     - remove a Reasonable Adjustment Flag
     
    The Flag consists of three parts:
     - Details of consent to share the Flag and how this was obtained. Consent may have been given by the patient or via a 'best interest decision' under the [Mental Capacity Act (2005)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare or a court appointed deputy.
     - Details of impairments, which enable clinicians to understand the range of adjustments the patient may require. Note that the patient may decline to say what their impairments are.
     - Details of reasonable adjustments to services which are needed by the patient when providing their care. 

    This API can only be used by relevant health and care staff providing direct care, authenticated with an NHS [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards) or equivalent.

    The existance of a Flag is intended to be visible to all staff who have access to the patient record.  The contents of the Flag may only be visible to clinical staff - as determined by role-based access controls (RBAC). For more details see [Registration authorities and smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards).

    To find out more about how the Flag works, categories and types of adjustments and the recording of impairments see [How the Reasonable Adjustment Flag works](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#how-the-reasonable-adjustment-flag-works).

    To watch a video of a Reasonable Adjustment Flag being created in [SCRa](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-record-application) see [Creating a Reasonable Adjustment Flag on the NHS Spine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX-IwYXXEwE). 

    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## Related APIs
    To use this API, you will need the patient's NHS number, which can be retrieved by using the following API:

      - [Personal Demographics Service (FHIR) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this API to search for patients and retrieve their details.  This API can also be used to update their details in some cases.

     When using this API, we also recommend that you consider using these related APIs:

      - [Female Genital Mutilation Information Sharing System (FGM-IS)](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/fgm-v2.1/) - use this API to store and share FGM information of children under 18 with relevant NHS healthcare professionals across departments, organisations and geographical boundaries within England.

      - [Child Protection Information Sharing (CP-IS) - HL7 V3 API](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/child-protection-information-sharing-project/cp-is-domain-message-specification) - use this API to provide access to CP-IS, a sharing system which provides healthcare workers with access to recent unscheduled care attendance information for children under a local authority social care plan. 

      - [National Record Locator (NRL) (FHIR) API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nrl/) - use this API to locate and share patient records held within local health and social care systems.

    ## API Status and Roadmap
     This API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status) - expect further breaking changes.
     
     The API is currently available for sandbox testing, but not integration testing or for production use.
         
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=all&tag=reasonable-adjustment-flag#controls).

    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis). 

    It also conforms to the [FHIR (STU3)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically it conforms to [FHIR Release 3](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/).

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ### Resources
    For information on the resources used within the Reasonable Adjustment Flag API see [Reasonable Adjustment Flag FHIR specification](https://dev-reasonable-adjust-beta.netlify.app/explore.html).


    ## Network Access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network). To use this API with NHS [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards) (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare professional
    - strongly authenticated, using either an NHS [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards) or a [modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-care-identity-service-2/ways-to-authenticate-with-nhs-cis2) available via [NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-care-identity-service-2)

    The API uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security patterns:

    - [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
    - [user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    For more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).

    You must implement role-based access controls (RBAC) within your application to determine whether the end user is allowed to see (and update) the details of the record or only to know of its existence.

    For more details see [Registration authorities and smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards).

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
      - is for early developer testing
      - only covers a limited set of scenarios
      - is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
      - is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation 

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with options for user-restricted access (with or without [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards))

    To test updating patient details, you must set up your own test data.

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

    We will provide further details about how to onboard onto the API in January 2021.

    ## Using this API
    To check if a Reasonable Adjustment Flag exists:
     - get consent details - if they exist, the overall record exists

    To get a Reasonable Adjustment Flag:
     - get consent details
     - get reasonable adjustment details - which might not exist
     - get impairments - which might not exist

    To create a Reasonable Adjustment Flag:
     - add consent details - doing this also creates the overall record
     - optionally, add reasonable adjustments
     - optionally, add impairments

    To update a Reasonable Adjustment Flag:
     - get the relevant part(s) of the record first - you’ll need the version number for the update
     - update consent details, reasonable adjustments or impairments as appropriate

    To remove a Reasonable Adjustment Flag:
     - remove Reasonable Adjustment Flag record - this single operation will remove the record in its entirety

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to read details regarding the patient's consent to share a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) record, as well as how this was obtained. Consent may have been given by the patient or via a 'best interest decision' under the [Mental Capacity Act (2005)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare, or a court appointed deputy. Consent is usually obtained by a suitable member of staff discussing the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) with the patient, their carer or the appropriate patient representative. The member of staff will then record the type of consent captured, along with some free text details providing more information about who provided the consent.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to update details regarding the patient's consent to share a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) record, as well as how this was obtained. Consent may have been given by the patient or via a 'best interest decision' under the [Mental Capacity Act (2005)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/). In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare, or a court appointed deputy. Consent is usually obtained by a suitable member of staff discussing the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) with the patient, their carer or the appropriate patient representative. The member of staff will then record the type of consent captured, along with some free text details providing more information about who provided the consent.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to update a list of impairments held within the [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) information held on the [NHS Spine](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine). These impairments will likely have been captured during the discussion between the clinician and the patient or their carer. Patients may however decline to provide details of their impairments if they do not want to share them. To capture an impairment the member of staff selects an impairment type and then provides additional information using a free text field. For more details regards impairments see [How the Reasonable Adjustment Flag works](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#how-the-reasonable-adjustment-flag-works).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to update a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) against the patient record on the [NHS Spine](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine). This will describe the adjustment that the patient needs and will either be a coded national adjustment as defined by [SNOMED CT](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct), or an adjustment which has been manually keyed by a clinician. You can also use this endpoint to delete an existing adjustment. To find out more about the different types of adjustments see [How the Reasonable Adjustment Flag works](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag#how-the-reasonable-adjustment-flag-works).

      summary: Remove Reasonable Adjustment Flag record
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to remove a [Reasonable Adjustment Flag](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag) from the [NHS Spine](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine).  To remove a flag you must provide a reason for it being removed, for example the flag may have been created in error, or the flag may no longer apply to the patient. 

        For a patient it is represented as [CodeSystem-RARecord-RemovalReason-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/CodeSystem-RARecord-RemovalReason-1). This triggers the system to inactivate all Reasonable Adjustment Flag resources contained within the patient record.
